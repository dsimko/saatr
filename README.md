# SAATR 

Open source tool for Storing And Analyzing Tests Results.

##About
SAATR consists of two parts:

1. __Uploader__ (e.g. [simple bash script](https://github.com/dsimko/saatr/tree/master/saatr-uploader/scripts/post-build.sh)) which is intended to be part of your automated test execution controlled by a CI tool (e.g. Jenkins). At the end of a CI job the script collects all tests results (generated by the [Surefire Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin)) and uploads them to the Web application. 

2. __Web application__ stores all data in [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and provides powerful access to the history of your tests results. Main features are:
  - grouping of data for better overview about instabilities between runs
  - searching, filtering and comparing according to many parameters 
  - knowledge base about test failures - you can enrich data during investigation

##Usage
1) Start MongoDB.   
The easiest way is use docker e.g.:  
```sh
# start mongo (data will be stored on host file system on /var/saatr/datadir)
docker run --name saatr-mongo -v /var/saatr/datadir:/data/db -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:3.3.11
# find mongo IP address and then modify 'spring.data.mongodb.uri' property in 'saatr/src/main/resources/application.properties'
docker inspect saatr-mongo | grep IPAddress
```
2) Start the web application with the Spring Boot maven plugin (`mvn spring-boot:run`). The application is running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

##Contribution

Any feedback or contribution is very welcome.  

Web application is build with Apache Maven 3.3 and Java 1.8. For reducing boilerplate code is used [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) which needs to be installed to your IDE.
