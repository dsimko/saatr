# SAATR 

Open source tool for Storing And Analyzing Tests Results.

##About
SAATR consists from two parts:

1. __Uploader__ (e.g. [simple bash script](https://github.com/dsimko/saatr/tree/master/saatr-uploader/scripts/post-build.sh)) which is part of your automated test execution controlled by a CI tool (e.g. Jenkins). In the end of a CI job the script collects all tests results (generated by the [Surefire Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin)) and uploads them to the web application. 

2. __Web application__ which gives you access to the history of your tests results. Main features are:
  - powerful filtering and searching
  - grouping and comparing data which gives you solid overview about instabilities between releases 
  - knowledge base about test failures - you can enrich all data during investigation

##Requirements
Web application is build with with Maven and Java 1.8. All data are stored in MongoDB.

##Usage
1) Start MongoDB
The easiest way is use docker e.g.:  
```sh
# start mongo (data will be stored on host file system on /var/saatr/datadir)
docker run --name saatr-mongo -v /var/saatr/datadir:/data/db -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:3.3.11
# find mongo IP address and then modify 'spring.data.mongodb.uri' property in 'saatr/src/main/resources/application.properties'
docker inspect saatr-mongo | grep IPAddress
```
2) Start the application with the Spring Boot maven plugin (`mvn spring-boot:run`). The application is
running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
